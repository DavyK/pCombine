Reading map (extended format) from [ test.bim ] 
4 markers to be included from [ test.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ test.fam ] 
8 individuals read from [ test.fam ] 
4 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
4 cases, 0 controls and 4 missing
8 males, 0 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ test.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
4 founders and 4 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 0.84375
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
After filtering, 4 cases, 0 controls and 4 missing
