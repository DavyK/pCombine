Reading map (extended format) from [ chr22_test.bim ] 
8357 markers to be included from [ chr22_test.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ chr22_test.fam ] 
183 individuals read from [ chr22_test.fam ] 
183 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
85 cases, 98 controls and 0 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 183 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 183 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
